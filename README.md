##Instructions
The basic goal of the game of Battleship is to hide your ship fleet somewhere on your ocean(board) and by choosing coordinates on the enemy board, find your opponent's fleet before they find yours.

The game board each player gets has two grids: an upper and lower grid. The lower grid is used by the player to "hide" the location of his own ships, while the upper grid is used to record the shots fired toward the opponent and to document whether those shots were hits or misses.

When creating a new game, the players can choose their name, board size and set the rules of the game. After that, both players can choose to either place their ships manually or generate the ship locations randomly. Then the game starts where players take turns to strike their opponents fleets. Whoever destroys all the ships on their opponents fleet first, wins the game.
